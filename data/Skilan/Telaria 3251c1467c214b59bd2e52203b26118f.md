### Overview

Telaria is a peaceful and diplomatic country located on the continent of Aravia. Its culture values education and knowledge, and is home to many academies and institutes of learning. However, this focus on knowledge and enlightenment has also led to a certain elitism and exclusivity in Telarian society, and there is a distinct divide between the educated elite and the less privileged members of the population. The capital city of Telar is a center of culture and art, and is known for its beautiful architecture and gardens. However, behind the scenes, there are political factions and power struggles at play, and corruption and greed are not uncommon.

The people of Telaria are known for their kindness and hospitality, and the country has a long history of welcoming travelers and outsiders. However, this welcoming nature has also made Telaria a target for foreign invasions and attacks, and the country has had to defend itself against various threats over the years. Despite its commitment to peaceful resolution and diplomacy, Telaria has a well-trained and formidable military that is prepared to defend the country and its people.

In terms of its history, Telaria has a long and storied past. It was founded by a group of scholars and philosophers who sought to create a utopia based on knowledge and understanding.
